# 1032.Sharing\(25\)

To store English words, one method is to use linked lists and store a word letter by letter. To save some space, we may let the words share the same sublist if they share the same suffix. For example, `loading` and `being` are stored as showed in Figure 1.

Figure 1

You are supposed to find the starting position of the common suffix (e.g. the position of `i` in Figure 1).

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains two addresses of nodes and a positive *N* (≤105), where the two addresses are the addresses of the first nodes of the two words, and *N* is the total number of nodes. The address of a node is a 5-digit positive integer, and NULL is represented by −1.

Then *N* lines follow, each describes a node in the format:

```
Address Data Next
```

where`Address` is the position of the node, `Data` is the letter contained by this node which is an English letter chosen from { a-z, A-Z }, and `Next` is the position of the next node.

### Output Specification:

For each case, simply output the 5-digit starting position of the common suffix. If the two words have no common suffix, output `-1` instead.

### Sample Input 1:

```in
11111 22222 9
67890 i 00002
00010 a 12345
00003 g -1
12345 D 67890
00002 n 00003
22222 B 23456
11111 L 00001
23456 e 67890
00001 o 00010
```

### Sample Output 1:

```out
67890
```

### Sample Input 2:

```in
00001 00002 4
00001 a 10001
10001 s -1
00002 a 10002
10002 t -1
```

### Sample Output 2:

```out
-1
```

## cpp

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

struct NODE
{
    char key;
    int next;
    bool flag;
}node[100000];

int main()
{
    int n1, n2, n;
    scanf("%d%d%d", &n1, &n2, &n);
    char data;
    int a, b;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        scanf("%d %c %d", &a, &data, &b);
        node[a] = {data, b, false};
    }
    for (int i = n1; i != -1; i = node[i].next)
    {
        node[i].flag = true;
    }
    for (int i = n2; i != -1; i = node[i].next)
    {
        if (node[i].flag == true)
        {
            printf("%05d", i);
            return 0;
        }
    }
    printf("-1");
    return 0;
}
```

链表的数组写法. 本来想倒序找后缀的, 结果看题解发现题目没搞这种弯弯绕绕... 主要学了一下结构体的写法用法
